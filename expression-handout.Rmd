## Abstract

The bioconductor project publishes software and data for the analysis of functional genomics experiments, using a variety of techniques such as microarrays or second-generation sequencing. We will explore the bioconductor tools for expression analysis and pathway analysis and apply them to a demo dataset.

## Installing bioconductor

Bioconductor comes with it's own installation procedures for software and data packages, the `biocLite()` function. You can use it to install any bioconductor package, along with all prerequisites. For example, to install the `limma` package, we can use code like this:

```
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("limma")
```

Once you have sourced the biocLite file in your R session, you can continue to use it to install additional packages, such as the pathview package:

```
biocLite("pathview")
```

## Installing Data packages

Bioconductor includes many experimental data packages as well, that can be installed with `biocLite()` function as well:

```
biocLite("breastCancerMAINZ")
biocLite("hgu133a.db")
```

## Loading packages

Once packages have been installed, you need to load the package into each session that will use them. R-Studio will keep the packages loaded into a workspace, even if you exit and restart the program, as long as you save your workspace.

```{r}
library(Biobase)
library(limma)
library(breastCancerMAINZ)
data(mainz)
```


## Getting help.

bioconductor has extensive help available for almost all aspects.

```{r}
?mainz
?ExpressionSet
?limma
```

Of particular note, are the package vignettes, pdf files with tutorial examples of almost all packages.

## Examining the mainz breast cancer experiment

http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/68/13/5405.abstract

```{r}
dim(mainz)
head(pData(mainz))
pData(mainz)$e.dmfs
# count patients with distant metastasis before 5 years
sum(pData(mainz)$e.dmfs & pData(mainz)$t.dmfs < 1825)
head(featureNames(mainz))
annotation(mainz)
```

## Plot some data from mainz

```{r}
row = 21399

plot(exprs(mainz)[row,])
mainz.class <- (pData(mainz)$e.dmfs & pData(mainz)$t.dmfs < 1825)
mainz.fac <- factor(mainz.class, labels= c("CLEAR","DM"))
stripchart(exprs(mainz)[row,] ~ mainz.fac, method="jitter")
```

## Plot all the genes

Here's one of the 200 experiments.

```{r}
plotMA(mainz)
```

## Fitting a linear model

Suppose we want to find genes that change expression between the cases that have distant metastases in under 5 years from those that don't. We can fit a model to the data if we label each column with the variable of interest.

```{r}
design <- model.matrix(~0 + mainz.fac)
colnames(design) <- c("CLEAR", "DM")
fit <- lmFit(exprs(mainz), design)
cont.matrix <- makeContrasts(DMvsCLEAR = DM - CLEAR, levels = design)
fit2 <- contrasts.fit(fit, cont.matrix)
fit.b <- eBayes(fit2)
```

## Reporting the results

The resulting `fit.b` object has the results of the linear model fit, and we can produce plots and table summarizing the evidence for differential expression between the conditions.

The plot of the fit object shows the size of the predicted effect on each gene.

```{r}
plotMA(fit.b)
```

The volcanoplot shows the log odds of differential expression vs the log ratio of expression.

```{r}
volcanoplot(fit.b)
```

The topTable lists the genes ranked by the evidence of differential expression.

```{r}
topTable(fit.b, adjust = "BH")
```

## Mapping probe identifiers to external databases.

We can use bioconductor annotation packages to find the ENTREZ Gene ID for the probes in our dataset.

```{r}
library(hgu133a.db)
ls("package:hgu133a.db")
```

The package contains mappings from affy probe ids to many different databases. We're interested in the KEGG pathways:

```{r}
x <- hgu133aPATH2PROBE
# Get the probe identifiers that are mapped to a KEGG pathway
mapped_probes <- mappedkeys(x)
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x[mapped_probes])

indices <- ids2indices(xx, rownames(mainz))
```

Run `mroast` to find pathways with differential expression.

```{r}
res <- mroast(mainz, indices, design)
head(res)
```

To see the pathways we need a data matrix with ENTREZ Gene ID as the rowname

```{r}
x <- hgu133aENTREZID
# Convert to a list
xx <- as.list(x)
entrezid <- sapply(rownames(fit.b), function(x) xx[x], USE.NAMES=FALSE)
```

Now we can plot the Kegg pathway and color the nodes by their fitted expression estimates.

```{r}
library(pathview)
gene.data <- fit.b$coefficients
rownames(gene.data) <- entrezid
pv.out <- pathview(gene.data = gene.data, pathway.id = "04010", species = "hsa", 
                   out.suffix = "dmvsclear", kegg.native = T, same.layer = F)

pv.out <- pathview(gene.data = gene.data, pathway.id = "05200", species = "hsa", 
                   out.suffix = "dmvsclear", kegg.native = T, same.layer = F)

```
